            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SIR <hi>Carbery Pryſe</hi> being ſeized of the Inheritance of the Lands where the ſaid Mines are found, and the ſame being the largeſt Mines that were ever diſcovered in <hi>England,</hi> the Pattentees of Royal Mines pretended them to be Mines Royal, and ſued for the ſame; but the ſaid Sir <hi>Carbery Pryſe</hi> and Partners being now quieted in the Poſſeſſion of the ſaid Mines by two Verdicts at the <hi>Exchequer</hi> Bar, found for them by Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of great Quality both of <hi>Middleſex</hi> and <hi>Hartfordſhire,</hi> and alſo by Their Majeſties Special Order in granting them a <hi>Noli proſequi:</hi> And find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is neceſſary to take in more Partners and Sharers in order to find a vend for the great product of the ſaid Mines; for that by Experience it is found, that 600 men imployed in the great Vein alone will raiſe 15000 Tuns of Oar <hi>per Annum,</hi> which will yield in melting 10000 Tuns of Lead, which at 9 <hi>l. per</hi> Tun, comes to 90000 <hi>l.</hi> and the charge of digging it up, ſmelt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and carrying it to the Port of <hi>Aberdovey,</hi> comes but to 19500 <hi>l.</hi> ſo that the Net Profit of that Vein only will be 70500 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> if wrought to the beſt advantage, as by a juſt Computation thereof may appear. And the Profit of the Five other Veins already diſcovered, will alſo be very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, if wrought to the beſt advantage; to find a vend for which great quantities will require great Aſſiſtance and help. Now for the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch Gentlemen as will make it their buſineſs to find a vend for the vaſt product of this Mine,</p>
            <p>The ſame is divided into 4008 Shares, 2004 whereof are expoſed to ſale: the Perſons that now buy being to be let into profit from the firſt of this Inſtant, and to have a term of Two and twenty years and a half from that time. And to the end that many Perſons may be concerned in the ſaid Mines, which may conduce much towards finding a Vend for the ſaid Product of the ſaid Mines.</p>
            <p>It is Propoſed, That within 12 days after 1200 Shares are transferred, there ſhall be a Houſe taken, a general Meeting ſhall be ſummoned to chuſe 12 Aſſiſtants for the Year enſuing, who with the Chairman, make a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, and have the management of the ſaid Mines. The Aſſiſtants to be choſe yearly.</p>
